      h1 inamo restaurant
      p I created the software for <em>inamo</em>, an interactive experience voted "London's best restaurant" by TimeOut readers. I've written up a <a href="http://blog.berniesumption.com/software/inamo-case-study/">case study</a> describing my role, and a very geeky account of <a href="http://blog.berniesumption.com/software/inamo-mouse-system-multiple-mouse-pointers-in-flash/">one technical aspect</a> of the project. Or you can watch the video below and have some guy called Ant tell you about it. Thanks Ant.
